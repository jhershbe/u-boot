* Atheros PHY Device Tree binding

Required properties:
- reg: PHY address

Optional properties:
- atheros,clk-out-frequency: Clock frequency of the CLK_25M pin in Hz.
	Either 25000000, 50000000, 62500000 or 125000000.
- atheros,clk-out-strength: Clock output buffer driver strength.
	Either "full", "half" or "quarter".
- atheros,keep-pll-enabled: Keep the PLL running if no link is present.
	Don't go into hibernation mode.
- atheros,rgmii-io-1v8: Use 1.8V as RGMII I/O voltage, the default is 1.5V.

Example:

	ethernet-phy@0 {
		reg = <0>;
		atheros-clk-out-frequency = <125000000>;
		atheros,keep-pll-enabled;
		atheros,rgmii-io-1v8;
	};
